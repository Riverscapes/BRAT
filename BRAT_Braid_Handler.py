# Name:        BRAT Braid Handler
# Purpose:     Handles the braid clusters in a stream network
#
# Note: This tool is referred to in outputs as "anabranch handler", not "braid handler", for technical reasons. Out of a
# fear of breaking things, this name change generally has not been carried over to the code.
