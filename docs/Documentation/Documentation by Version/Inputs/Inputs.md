Due to the interest increased interest in BRAT, documentation has been constructed that outlines the inputs and outputs that were considered for the BRAT version the user is working with. We HIGHLY recommend the newest version of BRAT be the version that is used. Due to the work of the ETAL staff we are currently implementing changes to the model to make it more efficient and user friendly. Details about the most current version of BRAT to download can be found below.
