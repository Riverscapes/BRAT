# Glossary

Because field names in ArcGIS are limited to ten characters, there is a limit to how descriptive those names can be. This page is meant to be a reference for what each field in the stream network produced by BRAT is meant to represent.

## Current pyBRAT Values
These are values that are presently generated and used by the latest version of pyBRAT (3.0.20 at the time of writing). They are sorted by what stage they are created in, not alphabetically.

*For values for other versions of pyBRAT by version please refer to the lookup tables in the [pyBRAT Outputs](http://brat.riverscapes.xyz/Documentation/Outputs/) under the particular version #*

**FID -** This attribute is automatically assigned to every segment in a stream network. Each segment should have a unique FID value.

- Generation Method: Automatic

**Shape -** The type of vector that this element is. This attribute is automatically generated. In a stream network, this value should be *Polyline*.
- Field Type: "GEOMETRY"

## Depreciated pyBRAT Values
These are values that were once used by pyBRAT, but were discontinued for one reason or another.

**SegID -** Was renamed to ReachID. Served the same purpose.
**SegLength - ** Was renamed to ReachLen. Served the same purpose.
**IsBraided -** Was renamed to "IsMultiThr" for accuracy reasons. Served the same purpose.
**IsMainstem -** Was renamed to "IsMainCh" for clarity reasons. Served the same purpose.
