## Python Prerequisites
In order to use the [Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) Toolbox v 3](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT/releases/latest), your computer needs to have ArcGIS version 10.4 or later with the Spatial Analyst Extension as well as the scikit-fuzzy python module. Don't panic, even if you've never used a command line, you can follow these instructions. The video will show you how to install a few dependencies ( [NumPy_mkl](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy) and  [scikit-fuzzy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-fuzzy)) that BRAT uses. The video below provides detailed instructions on installing the [scikit-fuzzy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-fuzzy) python module.

**NOTE: The following video contains some information that is out of date. NumPy_mkl is no longer required to run BRAT**

You can download the software menitoned in the video from these links:
- [PipInstall](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) - only if you don't have it (usually installs with ArcGIS 10.4 or later)
- To install the [scikit-fuzzy module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-fuzzy), navigate in a command prompt to where Pip is located (e.g.  `c:\Python27\ArcGIS10.4\Scripts\`) and at command prompt type: `pip install scikit-fuzzy`. Note, the beauty of pip (Python Install Package) is that you don't have to go download these files, you just run ip and it downloads and installs them for you. 

## Installing BRAT
You can download the latest version of BRAT [here](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT/releases/latest). The video below walks you through the install process.

### Tips and Tricks
If you have done everything in the instructions above and are still encountering issues here are some common issues that our users...
- You are unable to uninstall numpy because it will only uninstall part of the module that exists on your pc. This is a common occurrance if you have multiple versions of Python installed on your pc. The best way to resolve this is to uninstall any versions of Python that you are not using and just use one.
- You still have the red x over the Toolset. Common issues if you have gone through the installation process above without encountering any errors is to check if your ArcGIS extentions are enabled. If they are then you can check to see if the features that you have checked under the "Borrow/Return" folder in ArcGIS Administrator are checked. If either of these are unchecked then you will encounter issues either now or later with BRAT.
