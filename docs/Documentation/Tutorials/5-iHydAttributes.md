title: Step 5 - iHyd Attributes
weight: 7

## Concept

The "iHyd" tool basically helps you prepare the hydrologic inputs to BRAT (namely a baseflow statistic and a typical flood statistic). Since BRAT is not a hydrologic model (i.e. a model that takes precipitation and a routes it as runoff across a watershed), we simply use regional curves to estimate a flow statistic for every reach. In other words, we can calculate upstream drainage area for every reach from the DEM, and use regional curves. These regonal curves take many forms, but generally relate discharge (y in figure below) to drainage area (x in figure below):

## What you need

To populate the "iHyd" or hydrologic attributes to the input table you created in the [previous step]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/Tutorials/4-BRATTableTool.html), regressions for predicting stream flow must first be developed or obtained for your model watershed, and then added to the model.  For example, these regional curves are what drives  [USGS's StreamStats Tool](https://streamstats.usgs.gov/ss/).  Note, you can maually develop your own regional curves for areas they are not defined based on analyzing avialable gage data

Once you have the regressions for both a typical low flow (we often use the flow exceeded 80% of the time) and a typical flood (we often use a two year recurrence interval flow), you must modify the script of the iHyd Attributes tool.  To do so, open the `iHyd.py` file (found inside the toolbox) in a python text editor.  [Pyscripter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) work well.

### Editing the `iHyd.py` to add your Regional Curves

For each area that you want to add a regression for a block of code must be added in the appropriate place.

![ihyd_code]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/ihyd_code.PNG)

The code block should follow this format:

``` python
elif float(region) == <choose an integer>:  # describe the area using the pound/hash sign in front
```
​    `Qlow` = <enter low flow regression here, always referring to drainage area as DAsqm>

​    `Q2` = <enter Q2 regression here, always referring to drainage area as DAsqm>

Note that in line 2 and 3 a TAB is used to indent.

As an example, say I want to add a regression for the Bridge Creek watershed in Oregon.  I would add the following block:
``` python
elif float(region) == 24: #oregon region 5
```

​    `Qlow = 1.31397 * (10 ** -20.5528) * (DAsqm ** 0.9225) * (16.7 ** 3.1868) * (6810 ** 3.8546)`

​   `Q2 = 1.06994 * (10 ** -9.3221) * (DAsqm ** 0.9418) * (16.7 ** 2.692) * (6810 ** 1.5663)` 

the script would then look like this:

![ihyd_code2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/ihyd_code2.PNG)

After any necessary regressions have been entered, save the changes to the script, and then update the toolbox in ArcMap by right clicking on it and clicking "refresh".  The iHyd Attributes tool can now be run.

#### Inputs and Parameters:

![iHyd]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/iHyd_new.PNG)


- **Input BRAT Network**  - select the network that was created using the BRAT Table tool
- **Select Hydrologic Region** -  enter the integer that was used to identify the regression you want to use.  In the example here we used the number 24. If specified, the region number is included in the project XML for future reference.
- **Baseflow Equation** - write the baseflow equation used, the Qlow specified in the code, so that the equation can be included in the project XML.
- **Highflow Equation** - write the highflow equation used, the Q2 specified in the code, so that it can be included in the project XML.

After running, in addition to creating and calculating the iHyd fields, it will create a folder in `01_Intermediates` called `##_Hydrology`, which will contain layers symbolizing base flow and high flow stream power.
